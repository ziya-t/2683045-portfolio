     <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Ziya, I'm a 3rd year university student. I enjoy finding music from different places.</p>
      <p>I think ducks are swag. I believe people must learn how to enjoy learning for the sake of it and not only for the purpose of getting a degree or a job. Whale's are rad too.</p>
