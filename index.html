     <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Ziya, I'm a 3rd year university student. I enjoy finding music from different places. I'm studying mathematics and computer science.</p>
      <p>Ducks are really rad. I think people should embrace failing at things and enjoy learning despite failure. Else we're all kind of just sheep studying for the sake of survival under capitalism and not learning for the sake of it.</p>
